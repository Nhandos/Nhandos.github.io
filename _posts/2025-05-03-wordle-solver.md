## Wordle in one paragraph

Wordle is a single-player **Mastermind** variant played on five-letter English words. Each guess returns a five-symbol *pattern*:
* 2 / üü© - correct letter, correct slot
* 1 / üü® - letter exists elsewhere
* 0 / ‚¨ú - letter not in the word (or fully accounted for)

You win when the pattern is üü©üü©üü©üü©üü© - and you have only six guesses. A solver's job is to choose guesses that zero-in on the secret word as fast as possible.

## Algorithm 

### **Step 1: Build a 'prior' over the answer list**
Let $\mathcal{W}$ be the dictionary of 5-letter words valid in a game of Wordle, and treat the secret word as a random variable $W\in\mathcal{W}$. The **probability mass function** (pmf)

$$
P_W(w) = Pr\set{W=w}
$$

tells us how plausible each candidate is. 

**3Blue1Brown** use a text corpus and apply a steep sigmoid that keeps the first $15,000$ words nearly uniform and then roll off smoothly. The corpus is sorted from most frequent to least frequent where the most frequent word has a **rank** $r(w)=1$.

$$
\text{Weight}(w) =
\displaystyle
\frac{1}{1 + e^{\,\alpha\,\bigl(r(w) - 15\,000\bigr)}}
\qquad\qquad (\alpha \gtrsim 0.001\text{‚Äì}0.005)
$$

$$
P_W(w)
\;=\;
\frac{\text{Weight}(w)}
     {\displaystyle\sum_{v\in{W}} \text{Weight}(v)}.
$$

### **Step 2: Turn a guess into a random pattern**

Define the **"Wordle clue function"** as

$f(\mathcal{W},\mathcal{W})\rightarrow\Set{0,1,2}^5$,

Example

$$
f(\text{CRANE},\text{CARER}) = (2,0,1,2,1) = üü© ‚¨ú üü® üü© üü® 
$$


Let $X$ be the random variable to represent the 5-symbol pattern clue and $G\in\mathcal{W}$ as our guess

$$
X = f(W,G)
$$

where $X$ can take $3^5=\boldsymbol{243}$ values, encoded $0...242$. 

Since we know the distribution of $W$ from the prior we built in step 1, we can determine the distribution of $X$ by applying [transformations of random variables](https://stats.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Probability_Theory/Probability_Mathematical_Statistics_and_Stochastic_Processes_(Siegrist)/03%3A_Distributions/3.07%3A_Transformations_of_Random_Variables). Using the indicator function $\boldsymbol{1}[]$, the probability  of seeing a particular pattern $x$ given $G$ is 

$$
P_{X\mid G}(x)
= \sum_{w\in\mathcal{W}}\;
    \underbrace{\Pr\bigl\{W=w\bigr\}}_{=\,P_W(w)}
    \times
    \underbrace{\mathbf 1\!\bigl[f(w,G)=x\bigr]}_{1\text{ if pattern matches, else }0}
$$

The equation above can be interpreted as: "*add up the prior probabilities of every word that would produce pattern* $\mathcal{x}$ *when you guess* $ G$".

### **Step 3: Score a guess with entropy**

For any guess $G\in\mathcal{W}$ we can compute the entropy of the pattern random variable 

$$
H(X\mid{G})=-\sum_{\mathcal{x}}{P_{X\mid G}(x)\log_2{P_{X\mid G}(x)}}
$$

A large entropy means **‚Äúthis guess, on average, chops the current candidate pool into many equally‚Äësized chunks.‚Äù**
Hence the classic information‚Äëtheory policy is

$$
G_{\text{entropy}} = \arg\max_{G\in\mathcal{W}}{H(X\mid{G})}
$$

That policy is superb when thousands of words are still possible, but it loses its edge once the candidate set $W$
shrinks to a few dozen. At that point you also care about:

* "What's the chance I simply *hit* the answer right now?"
* "If I miss, how many moves will I need afterwards?"

To balance these two effects, **3Blue1Brown** defines an *expected-moves* function as a function of the current entropy of the candidate words set $W$.

$$
S(E) (\text{units: guesses still needed})
$$

where $E=log_2{|W_n|}$ is the current "bits of uncertainty."
The key approximation is 

$$
\mathbb{E}[\text{future moves}\mid G] 
  = P_{W}(G) + (1 - P_{W}(G))\, S\!\bigl(E - H(X\mid G)\bigr)
$$

* $P_W(G)$ is the probability we *hit* the answer out right
* If we miss the answer, our entropy is expected to drop from $E$ to $E - H(X\mid{G})$ we then look up how many moves that entropy typically costs and weigh it the the probability $1 - P_W(G)$

Finally the best guess is

$$
G_{\text{best}} 
  = \arg\min_{G \in \mathcal{W}} 
        \Bigl[\,P_W(G) + (1 - P_{W}(G))\, S\!\bigl(E - H(X\mid G)\bigr)\Bigr]
$$

#### Where does $S(E)$ come from? (Boot-strapping)

Exactly computing $S(E)$ for every real Wordle state is expensive. So it is done empirically by simulating many games with the sub-optimal guess that maximize entropy only:
1. Simulate many games that always take the max-entropy guess.
2. Record pairs (E, moves-remaining).
3. Fit / interpolate those pairs to obtain a smooth curve S(E)


### **Step 4: Narrow down W and repeat**

After playing the best guess $G_n$, and observing the actual pattern $x_{n} = f(w_{\text{true}},G_n)$, we eliminate any words that wouldn't have produced the pattern:

$$
W_{n+1}\leftarrow\set{w\in{W_n}:f(w,G_n)=x_n}
$$

We then update the prior $P_{W}(w)$ that we built in step 1 using only $W_{n+1}$ rather the entire dictionary, and repeat these steps using the new prior until the pattern is üü©üü©üü©üü©üü© or six guesses are used.

## Rust implementation

For an implementation in Rust, see [https://github.com/Nhandos/rust-wordle](https://github.com/Nhandos/rust-wordle).

## Results

Below is the result of my algorithm using this [corpus](https://wortschatz.uni-leipzig.de/en/download/English) with the total word list being the top 4047 most frequently used 5-letters in that corpus.

On the horizontal axis is the entropy of the candidate list and the vertical axis is how many guesses the solver still needs on average to finish. When the game begins we get around (12 bits) of uncertainty and the solver typically needs around 2.8 guesses to finish. 

## Conclusion

I achieved what I wanted with this mini project which is to brush up on my probability and to learn a bit of rust. I got lazy towards the end and relied a bit more on generative AI than I'd like. The result shown above is probably going to be much different than **3Blue1Brown**'s because they used a much larger word list.
